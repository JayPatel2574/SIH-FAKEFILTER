## Proposed Solution

**GAN-Based Deepfake Detection**:  
We will utilize a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework with a series of deep-layered discriminators, each tailored to extract inconsistencies and relevant features and perform final classification for thorough image analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-Scale Convolutional Layers**: Parallel layers with varying kernel sizes to capture detailed and broad image features.
- **Temporal Dynamics with RNN and LSTM**: Processing sequential feature maps to capture subtle temporal inconsistencies.
- **Enhanced Deep Network Architecture**: Incorporating residual blocks and skip connections for better training and efficient gradient flow.

### Advanced Classification:
- **Feature Synthesis**: Aggregating features through a feedforward neural network.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining outputs from multiple discriminators for robust and accurate deepfake detection.
